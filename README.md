# GAME

         The game Corner the King is played on a checkerboard. To begin, a checker is
        randomly placed in the bottom row. The player can move one or two squares to the
        left or upwards, and then the computer can move one or two squares left or up. The
        first to reach the upper-left corner wins. Design a game in which the computerâ€™s
        moves are chosen randomly. When the game ends, display a message that indicates
        the winner. Save the game as CornerTheKing.java
